# Computer_Vision_Course_Project_Object_Detection

This is the report of my Introduction to Computer Vision course project. This project aims to develop a
system that can detect a given object (i.e. a particular instance) in a test image. To elaborate, a reference
image of the object to search for is provided, and we will be operating under the assumption that the object
is not occluded in the reference image, and is also the only object there. The reference image trivially defines
a bounding box for the object of interest. An intuitive idea of detected instance of the object in the test
image is to specify how to overlay the reference image over the test image so that the detected instance
would align with the reference instance. Please refer to the ipynb notebook, as well as the project report for
more details about the implementation, results and code.
